# Nanobot

Personal fork of the RuneLite modded OSRS botting client Microbot. Here I will add any features, changes and general updates I wish with only my vision in mind. I have nothing against the Microbot team, I have a lot of respect for them and their work in fact. But I enjoy building freely and as a product with a demanding userbase they have a lot on their plate, as such I will be putting forward those things I find myself working on here and trying to sync the two repos when possible.
